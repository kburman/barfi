This is hobby OS for 32 bit system. I am writing it for fun this will be desgined how i think an OS should be rather than common way.
By this i don't mean that Everything other than it are wrong i just want to implement the idea and see if really works.

Work Done:
  GDT,IDT,IRQ Setput
  Timer added
  Console
  Keyboard [ Some issue with cursor buts its funny to watch it dancing.]
  
Future Work:
  Long list there is still a lot of work to be done so i am thinking about the future.
  
  
  
Getting Started:
  i will recommend to build it from source and run the iso but if you are to lazy you can use iso file but i have't added any usefull thing in the 
  kernel_start so you may expect to see a use less window with some txt.
  
How to Build:
  open terminal
  then 
  cd /pathto_this_repo/
  make
  
and thats all it will by default build the kernel and iso image and then run it in Qemu
